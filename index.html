      <h3>Lady Dama</h3>
      <p>Lady Dama has been with us for a few months now. When she came to us, she was truly a wreck.
      She's doing much better now, getting through some bouts of depression (seasonal affective disorder,
      no doubt) but she's getting there. Nothing a friend couldn't take care of. Most cats are are a bit
      keep to themselves but Lady Dama is certainly and exception. Her passion is people.</p>
